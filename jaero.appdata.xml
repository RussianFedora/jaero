  <summary>A SatCom ACARS demodulator and decoder for the Aero standard</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
        JAERO is a program that demodulates and decodes Classic Aero ACARS (Aircraft
        Communications Addressing and Reporting System) messages sent from satellites to
        aeroplanes (SatCom ACARS), commonly used when planes are beyond VHF range.

        Demodulation is performed using the soundcard.

        Such signals are typically around 1.5Ghz and can be received with a
        low-gain antenna that can be home-brewed in conjunction with an
        RTL-SDR dongle.
